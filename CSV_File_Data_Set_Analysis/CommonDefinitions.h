/**
 * CommonDefinitions code: The CommonDefinitions file provides a set of common constants, macros, and functions used throughout the program.
 *
 * The majority of their use is found in facilitating special case operations such as detecting occurrences of date/time strings and extracting
 * string representations of variable names from arrays.
 * The creation of this file and the inclusion of these definitions were primarily motivated by the need to distinctly separate these special case
 * definitions from the main program logic and to provide a convenient way to access these definitions across the program.
 *
 * Furthermore, while the majority of these definitions find use exclusively in special case operations, there are a number that are more general in nature,
 * and find use in a variety of contexts throughout the program. Meaning, the definitions included in this file may be broadly categorized into two groups:
 * 1. General definitions: These definitions are widely applicable and are used in a variety of contexts throughout the program.
 * 2. Special case definitions: These definitions are used in specific contexts and are not widely applicable across the program.
 *
 * The general definitions include constants such as 'MAX_STRING_SIZE', which specifies the maximum size of a string, and macros
 * such as 'ARRAY_SIZE', which computes the number of elements in a statically-allocated array. The special case definitions include
 * constants such as 'months', which is an array of the names of the twelve months of the year, and 'commonDateTimeFormats', which is an array
 * of commonly used date/time formats and is used for parsing and formatting date/time strings.

------------------ MACROS FOR EXTRACTING STRING REPRESENTATIONS FROM VARIABLE NAMES AND ARRAY ELEMENTS ------------------
 * Macros defined for extracting string representations from names of variables and array elements.
 *
 * Throughout this program, there are several instances where both the name, denoting the type of data, and the contents of the actual
 * data are stored together as string representations within the same array(a double value of 6.0 will be stored as "6.0"). In such cases,
 * it becomes necessary to have methods for separating the name of the variable stored at a particular index of the array from the
 * contents of the variable stored at that index.
